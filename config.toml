With a background in conservation management, we are well aware of the current threats to our native wildlife and design our gardens accordingly. Peat bogs and the rare species associated with them are vanishing rapidly due to the extraction of peat for the gardening industry, so we only use peat-free compost. We design with water conservation in mind, and use plants which are best suited to the local environment to avoid the need for constant watering and pesticides. We use nectar rich and scented plants as standard (best for bees and butterflies) and stock a range of native wildflowers at our nursery for planting wildflower meadows. These wildflowers were all grown from seed gathered with kind permission from the reserves of the Wildlife Trust."
