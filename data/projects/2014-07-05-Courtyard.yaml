description: The central courtyard of these holiday cottages was a bleak, uninviting area that did not reflect the character of this 5-star accommodation. We designed and built a central feature consisting of four L-shaped raised beds to complement the symmetry of the surrounding historical buildings. This central area was paved with original slate flagstones to blend the new garden with the old buildings. We completed the design with a semi-formal planting scheme full of old fashioned flowers such as lavender, lupins, scabious, wallflowers and pinks. The design is low maintenance and incorporates a relaxing seating area.
