description: "The clients lived in an attractive period house and had converted the adjoining mill buildings into holiday accommodation, which was due to open that summer. Unfortunately, the area around the new cottage was an untamed wilderness, where an attempt to build a pond had gone very wrong. In order to create the perfect pond, we began by excavating a larger pond with a deep sump to ensure two powerful pumps were permanently submerged. These pumps fed a slate cascade where water flooded into the pond over a staircase of natural slate (our clients were fortunate enough to own an abandoned slate quarry!)"
